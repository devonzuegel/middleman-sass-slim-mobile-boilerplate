#Mobile Boilerplate
http://html5boilerplate.com

##Summary:

This is the boilerplate for a mobile-friendly site. It was built with Middleman and based on a mobile HTML5 boilerplate, and I extended the boilerplate to also use compass/sass and slim. You can find this 'mobile first' baseline [here](https://github.com/shichuan/mobile-html5-boilerplate).
